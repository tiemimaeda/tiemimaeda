### 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile!  

My name is Tiemi Maeda, I'm from SP-Brazil 🇧🇷.
I worked for many years in Food & Nutrition industry and after 2 years of an adventure in Ireland, I got back to Brazil and finally decided to explore web development 💻. I joined the 3rd generation of 💛 [\<Laboratoria\>](https://www.laboratoria.la/br), a social startup that aims to empower women in technology. 

It's been about a year since I started this amazing journey and I'm loving it! I'm currently working with .NET applications and learnign a lot!

On my spare time I enjoy listening to music 🎧, watching movies 🎬 and TV series 📺, reading books 📖 and meet up with friends 🍻 (before covid 😓).


I'm also on LinkedIn!
